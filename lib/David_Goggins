I don't stop when I'm tired, I stop when I'm done.
From the time you take your first breath, you become eligible to die. You also become eligible to find your greatness and become the one warrior.
Greatness pulls mediocrity into the mud. Get out there and get after it.
Mental toughness is a lifestyle.
If you choose to do something, attack it.
Never let people who choose the path of least resistance steer you away from your chosen path of most resistance.
The only thing more contagious than a good attitude is a bad one.
Nobody cares what you did yesterday. What have you done today to better yourself?
Only you can master your mind, which is what it takes to live a bold life filled with accomplishments most people consider beyond their capability.
Be more than motivated, be more than driven, become literally obsessed to the point where people think you’re fucking nuts.
Denial is the ultimate comfort zone.
You are in danger of living a life so comfortable and soft, that you will die without ever realizing your true potential.
We’re either getting better or we’re getting worse.
Don’t focus on what you think you deserve. Take aim at what you are willing to earn.
You have to build calluses on your brain just like how you build calluses on your hands. Callus your mind through pain and suffering.
If you’re willing to suffer, and I mean suffer, your brain and body once connected together, can do anything.
A warrior is a guy that goes, ‘Im here again today. I’ll be here again tomorrow and the next day.’ It’s a person who puts no limit on what’s possible.
