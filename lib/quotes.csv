CT Fletcher|History never remembers the haters.
CT Fletcher|Some go big, I went enormous. Some set goals, I set milestones! Some climb hills, I climbed mountains! Some want growth, I command growth. Some said it was over, I said f*ck you!

CT Fletcher|You may fight me every step of the way, you may hurt, you may ache, but resistance is futile!
CT Fletcher|Greatness, in any field, cannot be achieved without obsession.
CT Fletcher|The most powerful motivational speeches that I’ve ever heard came from people who told me I couldn’t do something. I was bound and determined to show them that I could.
CT Fletcher|Never accept the limitations of someone else!
CT Fletcher|No matter how slow you go you are still lapping everybody on the couch.
CT Fletcher|You have to start, with the belief, that you can do something.
CT Fletcher|I don’t know how many more reps…I’ma do this till I can’t do it no more!
CT Fletcher|Everything is impossible, until someone crazy enough comes along and makes it possible.
CT Fletcher|You have no excuses, so no matter what, your nose bleeds, it’s that time of the month, the kids are crying, you don’t feel like it, your back hurts, you got aches and pains. It’s still your motherf*cking set. Let’s get it done!

Eric Thomas|Pain is temporary. It may last for a minute, or an hour or a day, or even a year. But eventually, it will subside. And something else takes its place. If I quit, however, it will last forever.
Eric Thomas|Sometimes it ain’t about being the most talented. Sometimes it ain’t about being the smartest. Sometimes it’s not even about working the hardest. Sometimes it’s about consistency! Consistency!
Eric Thomas|The most important thing is this: To be able at any moment, to sacrifice what you are, for what you will become!
Eric Thomas|Everybody has a dream, but not everybody has a grind.
Eric Thomas|There is nothing wrong with dreaming big dreams, just know that all roads that lead to success have to pass through Hardwork Boulevard at some point.
Eric Thomas|Winners focus on winning. Losers focus on winners.
Eric Thomas|Only those who risk going too far, can possibly find out how far one can go.
Eric Thomas|I’m not the smartest. But you will not out work me! I wake up every morning at 3 o’clock!
Eric Thomas|Most of you don’t want success as much as you want to sleep!
Eric Thomas|I’ve got a dream that’s worth more than my sleep.
Eric Thomas|Success is not for the weak and uncommitted… Sometimes it’s gonna hurt!
Eric Thomas|Stop the blame game. Stop! Stop looking out the window and look in the mirror!
Eric Thomas|Avoid being your own enemy.
Eric Thomas|You can’t cheat the grind, it knows hows much you’ve invested, it won’t give you nothing you haven’t worked for.
Eric Thomas|The difference between those who succeed and fail: not taking advantage of opportunities.
Eric Thomas|Things change for the better when we take responsibility for our own thoughts, decisions and actions.
Eric Thomas|Don’t cry to quit! You already in pain, you already hurt! Get a reward from it!
Eric Thomas|I started studying. I wasn’t watching the game no more. I wanted to study what was in Michael Jordan. I’m like “What’s in Michael Jordan? Michael Jordan got something in him?

Eric Thomas|Look in the mirror, that’s your competition.
Eric Thomas|No alarm clock needed, my passion wakes me.
Eric Thomas|Everybody wants to be a beast, until it’s time to do what real beasts do.
Eric Thomas|Most of you won’t be successful because when you’re studying and you get tired, you quit!
Eric Thomas|Because the time you spend on your cell phone, could be used for your success. The time you could be using to be successful, you’re using on the cell! And the cell phone is not bringing you nothing but a bill!
Eric Thomas|It’s one thing to talk about your destiny. It’s one thing to dream about your destiny. It’s one thing to look at your destiny. But it’s another thing – it is another thing – to make the decisions. To wake up when you know you supposed to wake up!
Eric Thomas|Sleep? “I don’t sleep.” You thought that was it? It goes deeper than going without sleep because you might miss the opportunity to succeed. No, no, no! It’s about No Days Off! No weekends! No Holidays! No Birthdays!
Eric Thomas|It’s realizing that a great dream is not as good as a great memory. The dream can be had by anyone. The memory – must be made.
Eric Thomas|This is what I’m saying, take advantage of opportunity, because if you do, doors are going to open up for you.
Eric Thomas|When you’re great! You attract great! When you’re average! You attract average.
Eric Thomas|You ain’t average! But you know what? You’re playing small because it’s easier to be average.
Eric Thomas|It’s not who you are that holds you back, it’s who you think you’re not.
Eric Thomas|Fall in love with the process and the results will come.
Eric Thomas|You are the executive director and screenwriter of your life.
Eric Thomas|Be stronger than your excuses.
Eric Thomas|Listen to me, even when you lose, it’s OK to lose, but you can never get comfortable with it. You can never be satisfied with losing. When you lose, it’s got to hurt.
Eric Thomas|Stop sabotaging yourself!
Eric Thomas|If it takes a boring Biology class, then I’m taking Biology. If I gotta go through Calculus to make my family get to a level they’ve never been too, then Calculus watch your back! Cause your boy is coming.
Eric Thomas|If you’re just reading the book she told you to read, you’re getting beat! You read what she told you to read and then you ask her what she reading, cause if you don’t get what she’s reading, she’s gonna always be the teacher, and you’re always gonna be the student!
Eric Thomas|It’s not about where you come from; it’s about heart! You come to a place where, you know, being smart ain’t enough. You gotta have heart.
Eric Thomas|I was homeless for two and half years. And the problem with most of you, you’ve never felt any pain before. Y’all spoiled.
Eric Thomas|Listen to me! No, to sleep when you should be working out. Saying no, to quitting when you still got a hundred more shots to make. Saying no, when your body says stop, but you put in fifty more push ups! You can’t just talk about it! You gotta be about it!
Eric Thomas|At the end of pain is success.
Eric Thomas|Stop being average. You’re not even good. You were born to be great.

Eric Thomas|If you can look up, you can get up.
Eric Thomas|Your relationships will either make you or break you and there is no such thing as a neutral relationship. People either inspire you to greatness or pull you down in the gutter, it’s that simple. No one fails alone, and no one succeeds alone.
Eric Thomas|Done is better than perfect if perfect ain’t done.
Eric Thomas|I have learned over the years that the higher the level of emotion, the lower the level of reasoning. For example, if your emotions are at the highest level of 10, your ability to reason is at a 0. If it’s a 9 then your reasoning is a 1. I am not suggesting that emotions don’t have their place, but taking actions based purely on emotions is dangerous and could cost you everything.
Eric Thomas|I do not take constructive criticism from people who have never constructed anything.
Eric Thomas|Success, meaningful success, begins when we take ownership and actively take responsibility for our part in the shortcomings of our life.
Eric Thomas|You can’t sleep. Broke people sleep. You got to be willing to sacrifice sleep, if you sleep you may miss the opportunity to be successful.
Eric Thomas|You can get through this. You are bigger than your pain, don’t give up, don’t give in.
Eric Thomas|It’s not easy, but it’s simple.
Jocko Willink|Discipline equals freedom.
Jocko Willink|It’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate.
Jocko Willink|The test is not a complex one: when the alarm goes off, do you get up out of bed, or do you lie there in comfort and fall back to sleep? If you have the discipline to get out of bed, you win—you pass the test. If you are mentally weak for that moment and you let that weakness keep you in bed, you fail. Though it seems small, that weakness translates to more significant decisions. But if you exercise discipline, that too translates to more substantial elements of your life.
Jocko Willink|Implementing Extreme Ownership requires checking your ego and operating with a high degree of humility. Admitting mistakes, taking ownership, and developing a plan to overcome challenges are integral to any successful team.
Jocko Willink|Don’t expect to be motivated every day to get out there and make things happen. You won’t be. Don’t count on motivation. Count on Discipline.
Jocko Willink|Don’t let your mind control you. Control your mind.
Jocko Willink|Stop researching every aspect of it and reading all about it and debating the pros and cons of it … Start doing it.
Jocko Willink|Don’t fight stress. Embrace it. Turn it on itself. Use it to make yourself sharper and more alert. Use it to make you think and learn and get better and smarter and more effective. Use the stress to make you a better you.

Arnold Schwarzenegger|What is the point of being on this Earth if you are going to be like everyone else?
Arnold Schwarzenegger|Just like in bodybuilding, failure is also a necessary experience for growth in our own lives, for if we’re never tested to our limits, how will we know how strong we really are? How will we ever grow?
Arnold Schwarzenegger|For me life is continuously being hungry. The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|Help others and give something back. I guarantee you will discover that while public service improves the lives and the world around you, its greatest reward is the enrichment and new meaning it will bring your own life.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|The mind is the limit. As long as the mind can envision the fact that you can do something, you can do it, as long as you really believe 100 percent.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|The last three or four reps is what makes the muscle grow. This area of pain divides the champion from someone else who is not a champion. That’s what most people lack, having the guts to go on and just say they’ll go through the pain no matter what happens.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|If you don’t find the time, if you don’t do the work, you don’t get the results.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|Positive thinking can be contagious. Being surrounded by winners helps you develop into a winner.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|It’s not what you get out of life that counts. Break your mirrors! In our society that is so self-absorbed, begin to look less at yourself and more at each other. you’ll get more satisfaction from having improved your neighborhood, your town, your state, your country, and your fellow human beings than you’ll ever get from your muscles, your figure, your automobile, your house, or your credit rating
Arnold Schwarzenegger|I never felt that I was good enough, strong enough, smart enough. He let me know that there was always room for improvement. A lot of sons would have been crippled by his demands, but instead the discipline rubbed off on me. I turned it into drive.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|The more knowledge you have, the more you’re free to rely on your instincts.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|I knew I was a winner back in the late sixties. I knew I was destined for great things. People will say that kind of thinking is totally immodest. I agree. Modesty is not a word that applies to me in any way – I hope it never will.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|I don’t walk away from things that I think are unfinished.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|Life may be full of pain but that’s not an excuse to give up.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|I would never exchange my life with anybody else’s.
Arnold Schwarzenegger|Learned helplessness is the giving-up reaction, the quitting response that follows from the belief that whatever you do doesn’t matter.
